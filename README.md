## 🎯 Research Questions / Hypothesis

- How can generative AI techniques improve the accuracy of soil profile predictions?
- What are the key features that influence soil profile characteristics?

---

## 🛠️ Methodology

> _Describe the methodology used. What models, algorithms, or statistical techniques were employed? What was the experimental setup?_

The repo contains simple stochastic generative methods to generate soil profiles, as well as to create the dataset for the training of generative AI models. By using and understading synthetic data, the model is expecting a faster feedback loop in their training and testing, compared to human-made soil profiles.

## 🚀 How to Reproduce

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KurtSoncco/gen-ai-soil-profiles.git
    cd gen-ai-soil-profiles
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment using `uv`:**
    This will create a virtual environment in the `.venv` directory.
    ```bash
    pyenv local 3.11
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Sync dependencies using `uv`:**
    This command installs the project dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.
    ```bash
    uv sync --extra dev
    ```
4.  **Run the analysis:**
    To run the test suite, execute the following command from the root directory:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
    For other analyses, you can run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
